## Our Mission

*The mission of the Tuscaloosa Area Black Chamber of Commerce, Inc. is to promote economic development in the Tuscaloosa County, AL African-American community and surrounding under-represented communities of West Alabama by developing economic empowerment strategies that will assist current and future Black or under-represented business owners in becoming sustainable.*

To this end, the corporation shall endeavor and sustain West Alabama communities, particularly Tuscaloosa and surrounding communities by:

Promoting economic growth and development within underserved communities in West Alabama
Promoting an understanding of the American Free Enterprise system through education, research, and development of model programs
Promoting and enhancing leadership, individual involvement, and community development through public forums and training
Conducting seminars designed to educate participants in the management of trade and professional associations and business enterprises
Sponsoring educational seminars and conferences to educate youth in entrepreneurship and leadership development

## Why a "Black" Chamber?

TABCC exists because we believe in education advocacy. State statistics reveal that there is no all-in-one box for minority business needs. The more informed we are, the better we are to navigate in a competitive environment, and overcome the history and culture of Alabama that considers Black Businesses different therefore inferior.
